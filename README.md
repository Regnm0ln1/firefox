# Firefox customizations

All the files in my chrome folder

## Install instructions:
Copy the chrome folder and add it to the profile that you wish to change, the file path for this can be found in firefox by searching for "about:support" and locating the row "profile folder". 
This setup also uses UserChrome.js to get the sidebar tabs, it is also possible to get this by using extentions like treestyletabs.

To install UserChrome.js follow the instructions in "https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomJSforFx", these steps are needed for loading js scripts.
